# Expense Tracker

I created this app based on a home assignment I was given.

The app should contain 5 screens.

- Welcome screen:
    - Root screen
    - When navigating from this screen, a user should not be able to go back.

-  Bottom tabs layout

    - Home screen: * default screen *
        -  Expenses filter modal
        - Create / Edit expense modal
    - Profile screen
        
● Welcome Screen
- A user should be able to insert his full name and submit.
- The welcome screen should only be shown if there’s no indication for a name already.

● Home Screen
- A user should see his full name in the navigation top bar title.
- Should present all the expenses and the total amount.
- The expenses list should be sectioned by dates.
- The expenses list should be ordered by a descending date.
- Should allow filtering expenses by title, amount or date.

● Create / Edit expense Modal
- Expense must have the current properties:
    - Title
    - Amount
    - Date
- A user should be able either to create a new expense or edit / remove an existing one.
- Changes should take effect only when pressing the “Create / Save” button.

● Expenses Filters Modal
- A user should be able to filter by any expense field.
- Changes should take effect only when pressing the “Filter” button.
- A user should be able to clean all the active filters by pressing the “clean” button.
  
● Profile Screen
- A user should see his full name in the navigation top bar title.
- Should present number of total expenses items
- A user should be able to sign out from the app.
